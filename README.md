# fdt
An overly complicated command line application

## Introduction
This piece of software was developed and tested on MacOS. Considering its quite heavy reliance on OS-specific commands to start it, please do not use this on any other Unix, Un*x, or Windows machine unless you know that it will work, or have a better way of doing it.  
## Usage
1. Download both files into a directory somewhere (**not ~/**)  
2. Run run.sh
3. To run the program, you can now simply call ``~/fdt`` from anywhere.
